## <h1 align="center">My name is Nikolai Korobov</a>

<p align="center">:construction: <b>Work in Progress</b> :construction:</p>

As a Game Software Engineer, I have accrued 4+ years of experience, specializing in Render Programming for the first three years.

Currently, I'm broadening my expertise by venturing into various aspects of web development with frontend being my main focus.

### Core Skills
- C++17 / Unreal Engine
- Algorithms / DS

### Secondary Skills
- DirectX 11 / HLSL
- Java (ask me about that one time I've been testing UE with JUnit)
- SQL
- CI/CD (setting up github actions for a monorepo was _fun_)
- SOLID / DRY / KISS / Common Design Patterns

### Exploring Now
- Frontend Development: Typescript + React
- Backend Development: Go / Typescript, it's hard to make a choice at the moment.
